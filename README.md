Use tensorflow and keras to predict the images in the mnist data set

Shout out to the following people / entities who have helped me through making this
Jeff Heaton heatonresearch.com his github pages and youtube videos were very helpful 
in setting the foundation and building the templates and snippets that I borrowed from
heavily.

Samson Zhang. Your video about building a neural network from scratch helped demistify the algorithims behind the scenes that made diagnosing and fixing issues relatively straightforward. 

Peter J. Simmons. My math and computer science teacher in high school. He taught me how to code back when visual basic was still a thing, and his lessons still stick even after all there years. Document and comment everything. Use descriptive variables and KISS. That approach has helped me immensely in more than just writing code

CHATGPT. Seriously, saved me tons of time pouring over stackoverflow and tensorflow forums when it came to providing working code snippets and examples. This is a game changing technology and I hope that it is used to make things better.

Last and not least. Jesus Christ, my Lord and Savior. I give you thanks for strength equal my challenges and not challenges equal to my strength. All praise and all glory are yours.
